# Introduction

Civic is a tool to help you separate your CV to data and presentation layers.
The idea is to simplify the maintenance of your CV by keeping your CV data
in a structured format that can be easily navigated and changed. In addition,
you can create or use an existing themes to build your CV information in an
appealing design and generate an output you can share with others.

Civic can make your life an epsilon bit easier, if you have ever thought of
these questions:

- In which file format should I keep my CV? HTML, PDF, DOCX, or something else?
- Should I use an online CV builder or a template? If yes, which one?
- Do I feel comfortable to update my CV for a tiny change?
- How can I keep my CV up to date with my latest experiences and skills?
- How should I design my CV and which tool should I use? Word, Photoshop,
  Figma, or something else?
- ...

Civic's code base and logic is not complicated at all, but it solves one of
my concerns. Hope it can help you too. ðŸ¤ž

## Scenarios

### ðŸªª Update CV Data
Do you need to add a new experience or add Haskell to your skills? Just open
your configuration file, adds it wherever you want and don't worry about the
design. Now, use Civic's CLI to build your CV with the updated information. ðŸš€

### ðŸŽ¨ Change Design
Do you need to change how your CV looks? Just come up with the new civic
template of your own or find one from our template registry. Replace your
desired template name/link in your configuration and run the CLI again. ðŸš€
